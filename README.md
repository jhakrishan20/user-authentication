Hi there , this is my first basic backend api and also my first git repository.
<br>
<p3>Overview</p3>
<br>
In this project I tried to make a  basic user authentication api in node.js using passport.js as middleware.
It could be done without using passport.js but using a middleware like passport.js provides you plenty of versatile features that you can directly use into your project.

<br>
This api asks for user registration and stores the data in the database . Then there is a login section where users have to enter their credentials ie "Username and Password ". The algorithm searches for the provided username in the database . If the usernamae exists then it compares the password and you got log in . If the username does'nt exists then it'll redirect you to the registration section.If the credentials are wrong it'll return an error.
